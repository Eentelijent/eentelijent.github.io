      <h2>I. Different types of Housing</h2>
      <h3>1. Housing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> housing refers to structures/buildings developed to shelter
          people from the elements</li>
        <li> often seen as a basic need that everyone should have access
          to</li>
        <li> housing can be built in a <u>planned</u> or <u>unplanned</u>
          fashion</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Classification of housing</strong> <br>
      <br>
      Housing can be classified according to <u>height</u> and <u>density</u>
      <ul>
        <li> high rise, high density: nearer to city centre </li>
        <li> low rise, low density: around the <u>fringe</u> of a city</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Features of formal housing</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Built by government or private developers </h4>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li> in singapore, all public housing is developed by the HDB.
          </li>
          <li> such public housing can only be sold to <u>citizens</u>
            or <u>permanent residents</u></li>
          <li> plots of land may be sold to <u>private businesses</u>,
            who in turn develop <u>private housing projects</u> (e.g.
            condos)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <h4> Legal rights to occupy land</h4>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Definition:</b> the ability of individuals to freely
            occupy, acquire (obtain), use and possess land at their own

          <br>
          <li> formal housing refers to housing that is <u>built by
              people with legal right to occupy the land </u></li>
          <li> these properties may then be <u>leased</u> or <u>sold</u>
            to others</li>
        </ul>
        <li>

          <ul>
            <li>provision of sanitation services</li>
            <li>access to water <b>and </b> electricity</li>
          </ul>

          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>underground water pipes</li>
            <li>electrical sub-stations</li>
            <li>power lines</li>
            <li>sewage pipes (separate from water pipes) </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>High-quality building materials</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> could includes materials such as: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>concrete</li>
            <li>metal</li>
            <li>hardwood</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li> such materials may vary depending on: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>economic circumstances</li>
            <li>environmental circumstances</li>

          </ul>
          <li> In Singapore, all housing must conform to the
            specifications for building safety and quality drawn by the
            <u>Building and Construction Authority (BCA)</u>.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h3>4. Features of informal housing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mainly found in the outskirts and underdeveloped areas of
          cities</li>
        <li>Commonly known as squatter settlements</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Commonly have issues such as</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Social Unrest</li>
        <li>Degradation of environmental quality</li>
        <li>Widespread diseases</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>1. Self-built squatter settlements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Typically built by individuals in an unplanned version</li>
        <li>Often constructed from scavenged materials</li>
        <ul>
          <li>repurposed zinc sheets</li>
          <li>recycled timber</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Usage of inferior building materials → risk of:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Collapsing,</li>
          <li>Catching fire easily,</li>
          <li>Flooding on rainy days</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h4>2. No legal right to occupy land</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Land is built out of necessity</li>
        <li> Many informal houses occupy government land or private
          property which is undeveloped and unsecured</li>
        <li> Residents are often illegal occupants of the land</li>
        <li> Constant risk of losing their homes (eviction and houses
          cleared by developers/government)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4> 3. Lack of access to basic services</h4>
      <ul>
        <li> Not built in areas not meant for housing development,</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Lack of access to basic services (electricity, water and
            sanitation) --&gt; residents resort to:<br>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>illegal tapping onto nearby electric grinds, </li>
            <li> syphoning water from nearby pipes, </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li> disposing sanitary waste into the ground or nearby rivers.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Such practices increase the risk of waterborne diseases,
            consumption of contaminated water, and ill-health due to
            electrocution</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p> <br>
        <br>
        Types of housing in cities<br>
        <br>
        Formal housing: <br>
        Desirable land<br>
        Government or private developers are able to situate formal
        housing<br>
        Near greenery and amenities<br>
        Away from pollution <br>
        Quality infrastructure <br>
        Roads (Роад)<br>
        Piped water (пипдеь ватер) <br>
        Electricity (електриситий)<br>
        Proper waste disposal (пропер фасте диспосел)<br>
        <br>
        Informal housing<br>
        Locally unwanted land-use areas<br>
        Near industrial sites – lesser travelling time and costs (неар
        индастриал ситец)<br>
        The only space left (те онлий спасе лефт)<br>
        Nobody to develop the land&nbsp; (нет-бодиъ то девёлоп те
        ландиенска)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        III: Factors affecting the Location of Housing<br>
        Land-Use Planning<br>
        Definition: guidelines drawn by planning authorities<br>
        Common type of guideline: Zoning<br>
        <br>
        Zoning<br>
        Restricts the type of activities and land-use permitted on
        specific sites<br>
        Shapes layout of cities<br>
        Enables various types of development<br>
        <br>
        Developers<br>
        It can be affected by whether it is developed by private or
        public developers<br>
        Private developers: chooses more commercially-viable sites<br>
        Government: chooses people’s needs over profits<br>
        *Informal housing tend to occupy locations near large housing or
        industrial developments<br>
        <br>
        Land Prices<br>
        High land prices = houses have to be sold at higher prices<br>
        People will no longer be able to afford them<br>
        Governments must regulate land prices<br>
        High land prices may cause informal housing<br>
        <br>
        Housing financial support<br>
        Developers<br>
        Lower the cost of building houses for developers<br>
        Can encourage developers to build more houses → prevent housing
        shortage<br>
        Otherwise, most people will not be able to afford formal housing
        <br>
        Allows buildings to be more affordable<br>
        <br>
        People<br>
        Governments provide funding and subsidies to buy housing<br>
        BTO, HDB allow people to buy affordable formal housing<br>
