	<section id="1">
	<h3>Impact of developments of transport systems</h3>
	
	<h5>Impact on natural environment</h5>
	- Clearing of natural vegetation to obtain physical space
	- Road development can divide forests into smaller fragments
	- Reduces the size of animal habitats
	- Reduces the movement of animals
	- Deaths of animals trying to cross busy roads
	- Wildlife corridors
	- Alteration of natural landforms (rivers, mountains, slopes etc.)

	<h4>Carbon Footprint</h4>
	<strong>Definition:</strong>  Measure of greenhouse gases emitted to support human activities
	<strong>Fossil fuels</strong>
	- Motorised transport
	- Generation of electricity for electricity-powered transport
	- Growth of cities (more transportation built)
	- Transport amounts for 25-30% of greenhouse gas emissions

	<h4>Mobility</h4>
	<strong>Definition:</strong> ability of people and freight to move from place to place
	- Important as it allows people access to goods and services
	- Facilitates social interactions for our emotional well-being

    <h4>Physical capabilities & health-related conditions</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Traffic is diverted elsewhere (but still exists)</li>
        <li>Regulations have to be tightly enforced</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Examples</strong>

    to balance social, economic and transport needs, so that there is a balance in 
    social-economic and transport needs.</p>

    <h5>4. Land transport master plan (LTMP)</h5>
    <img src="lmtp.png">
    <strong>Key Idea</strong><br>
    Long-term plan to develop a transport network that is convenient, well-connected and fast.

    <strong>Aims</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop inclusive infrastructure</li>
        <li>Promote gracious behaviour</li>

    </ul>

    <u>Develop:</u>
    <ul>
        <li>20-minute towns</li>
        <li>45-minute cities</li>
    </ul>

    <u>Using:</u>
    <ul>
        <li>public</li>
        <li>active</li>
        <li>shared nodes</li>
    </ul>

    <u>To:</u>
    <ul>
        <li>Neighbourhood centres</li>
        <li>Across the city</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Results (Advantages)</strong>
    Good planning ensures that: <br>
    Transport facilities and services are able to move people and goods in a:
    <ul>
        <li>safe</li>
        <li>affordable</li>
        <li>convenient</li>
        <li>environmentally-friendly</li>
    </ul>
    manner.

    <h5>5. Provision of different mobility options for different groups of people</h5>
    <img src="tap-longer.png">
    <strong>Aims</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide <u>convenience</u> for people with <u>physical disabilities</u></li>
        <li>Encourage the people with physical disabilities to <u>go out more often</u> instead of <u>isolating themselves</u></li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Disadvantages</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Expensive</li>
        <li>Requres <u>large amounts of planning</u> to prevent <u>wastage of materials</u>
        --> requires a lot of <b>planning and discussion</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h5>6. Research and development in transport</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Digital apps</li>
        <li>EVs, AVs</li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Aim</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Explore ways to make transport systems more sustainable and convenient for people</li>
        <li>Make public transport more <u>attractive</u> --> <u>encourage</u> more people to take public transport</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce carbon footprint</li>
