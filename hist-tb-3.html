            <li>Earliest usage of the term 'South-east Asia: 1839, by an American author in his book,《<i>Travels in
                    South-Eastern Asia</i>》</li>
            <li>Officially used in WWII by the Allies: 《<i>Southeast Asia Command</i>》</li>

        <h3>Inaccuracies of using ASEAN to describe 'South-east Asia':</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ASEAN is an organisation and can change in size and scope</li>
            <li>ASEAN does not include Timor-Leste, which is geographically in SEA</li>

        <p>
            South-east Asia can be geographically divided into 2 parts: <u>main land</u> and <u>islands</u>.
        </p>
        <h4>Geographic features of SEA</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Many waterways and seas</li>
            <li>Many islands</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Trade and contact within SEA</h4>
        <p>Ships before the steam era relied heavily on the <u>monsoon season</u> for reliable travel schedules.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This allowed reliable trade schedules</li>
            <li>This allowed SEA to be a meeting point between traders between India and China</li>
            <li>This brought on the rise of many <u>maritime empires</u> (Thalassocracies)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Notable empires and kingdoms</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Funan (c. 60-500s A.D.)</li>
            <li>Srivijaya (600s-1300s A.D.)</li>
            <li>Majapahit (1200s-1500s A.D.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of these kingdoms would grow to become <u>empires</u> as they expanded.</p>

            <h3>Insular (Island) South-east Asia</h3>
            <p>Insular/<u>Maritime</u> South-east Asia is made out of >20,000 islands.</p>
            <h5>Island countries in South-East Asia</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Singapore</li>
                <li>Brunei</li>

                <li>Timor-Leste</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Geography</h4>
            <p>Insular Southeast Asia is surrounded by oceans and seas.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Oceans, seas and straits provide access to Island South-East Asia</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This <u>shaped travel</u> in the region</li>
                    <li>Such vital connections also shape the <u>economy</u></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The earliest kingdoms and empires in Insular Southeast Asia were formed along important <u>trade routes</u></li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h5>Rivers</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Used less for travel as they were relatively shorter</li>
                <li>Rivers are limited to a few regions (such as in Java, Indonesia)</li>
                <li>Provided fertile farmland for large-scale crop cultivation, such as <u>rice</u></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Future Europeans would be interested in using such fertile land to grow <u>cash crops</u></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>Economy</h4>
            <p>Many states were formed along the coasts of insular Southeast Asia due to the importance of islands and seas.</p>
            <h6>Characteristics of early South-east Asian economies</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Empires were based on <u>trade</u></li>

                    <li>These states could become very rich and powerful, e.g. Srivijaya</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Oceans and seas provided <b>food</b>, e.g. fish</li>

            <h4>Political Systems</h4>
            <h6>Political characteristics of early political systems in SEA</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Many <u>nation-states</u> without fixed borders</li>
                <li>States were based off the <u>personal authority</u> of their rulers (e.g kings)</li>
                <li>Boundaries were not fixed and could change at any time
                    <br>(this is understandable if you play civilisation)
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Establishment of new villages</li>
                    <li>Wars and conquest</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h6>Ruling Authority</h6>
            <p>Rulers were expected to have good characteristics, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ability to demonstrate leadership and display charisma</li>
                <li>Military prowess, winning wars</li>
                <li>Making good judgements</li>
                <li>Economy (if the rain is shit and all your crops fail your leader sucks)</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Divine right to rule</h6>
            <p>Rulers were believed to have divine origins and powers, which is reflected in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Religious symbols and special objects dedicated to rulers</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thrones</li>
                    <li>Royal umbrella</li>
                    <li>Sacred dagger/sword/other weapon</li>

                <li>Formal rituals (e.g. coronations)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Influence of rulers</h5>
            <p>Pre-colonial borders were more fluid and constantly changing as different rulers wielded different amounts of <u>power</u> and <u>influence</u>. As such, the size and boundaries of the state would change accordingly.</p>

                    <h6>Areas further from a ruler's main power centre</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Further regions are harder to access and control</li>
                        <li>Rulers would have to depend on local chiefs to enforce their order.</li>
                        <li>Local 'lower' rulers in peripheral regions would be more independent</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Local chiefs could pledge allegiance to 2 different rulers at any one time</li>
                            <li>Local chiefs held the power to ignore their superior and switch allegiance</li>
                            (basically feudalism)
                        </ul>

            <h4>People</h4>
            <p>Traders from many parts of Asia and the Middle East came to insular South-east Asia to trade due to its <u>openness to trade</u> <i>(the Brits will use this as justification for colonialism somewhere down the line.)</i></p>
            <h4>Culture and Religion</h4>
            <p>The importance of trade resulted in large amounts of <u>social interaction</u> between locals and many different foreign traders. <br>
            &emsp; --> Caused spread of different religions in SEA</p>
