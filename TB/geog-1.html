    <h2>What is the relationship between people and nature?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="li-head">Local communities and nearby nature areas are dependent upon each other.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>People are dependent on nature for many things:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Nature <u>provides essentials to living</u> such as air and water</li>
                <li>Living organisms like bees <u>pollinate crops</u> for a continuous supply of food</li>
                <li>Nature provides <u>spaces for recreation</u> and leisurely activites</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allows people to bond with their family and friends</li>
                    <br>This allows humans to maintain their <u>mental well-being</u>
                    <li>People can maintain their <u>physical well-being</u></li>
                </ul>
                <b>Example</b>:
                <ul><li>NParks' Therapeutic Gardens which help to connect people with nature and reduce their stress</li></ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Some nature areas are also dependent on local communities to thrive.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>People in the <b>neighbourhood</b> may tend to the <u>health of nearby natural areas</u>, ensuring that the plants and animals there thrive.</li>
                <li><u>Individuals</u> in local communities can <u>encourage one another</u> to enjoy nearby natural areas in a <u>sustainable manner</u> without <u>causing irreversible damage</u>.</li>
                <b>Example</b>:
                <ul><li>NParks organises a <u>range of activities for schools</u> during the week of international day of bio-diversity in May, such as the <u>Green Wave</u> campaign which aims to <b>educate</b> youths about the importance of protecting our natural environment.</li></ul>
                <br>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li class="li-head">Local communities and nearby nature areas <u>mutually affect</u> each other.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a mutual relationship, the parties involved (communities and nature) can bring about benefits to each other.</li>
            <li><b>Benefits to people:</b> Green spaces and urban <h>wildlife</h> in neighbourhoods can <u>enhance the mental health</u> and well-being of local communities.</li>
            <li><b>Benefits to nature areas:</b> Human activites can <u>enhance their biodiversity</u></li>
            <ul>
                <li>People can <u>gain enjoyment</u> and <u>enhance their mental health</u> (same as above)</li>
                <li>The overall health of the natural environment is enhanced as <u>more shelter and habitat</u> for <h>urban wildlife</h> to thrive are provided.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Local communities can <b>collectively raise awareness</b> about the value of nature areas through <u>encouraging positive behaviour</u> that does not damage nature.</li>

                    <li>The NParks Citizen Science initiative 《 Dragonfly Watch 》 trains participants to identify different dragonfly species at their assigned sites, resulting in <u>greater protection of the species (<i>pl.</i>)</u> via raising awareness of their importance in the environment</li>

                <li>Local communities can also <u>organise</u> or <u>participate</u> in conservation efforts.</li>

        <ol>

            <b>Causing soil erosion and damaging vegetation:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>When people hike along non-designated trails in nature areas:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This may cause <u><h>soil compaction</h></u> which prevents rainwater from infiltrating the surface. This leads to <u>high surface flows</u> and <u>soil erosion</u> as flowing water washes away the soil particles.</li>
                    <li>They may trample on vegetation, damaging plants and affecting their growth.</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Example</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>In 2014, human activites in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve caused such severe soil erosion and habitat degradation that public access to the nature reserved had to be limited for 2 years.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Worsening pollution and disturbing wildlife:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Littering</u> can worsen pollution in natural areas</li>
                <li>Animals can <u>get injured</u> by sharp objects (e.g. metal cans) or <u>become entangled</u> with plastic containers and bags</li>
                <li>Animals can <u>mistake rubbish for food</u> and consume them, causing them to get hurt and eventually lead to their death</li>
                <li><u>Feeding wild animals</u> may also lead to <b>changes in the habits and behaviour of wildlife</b>. Human-wildlife conflict can increase when <u>animals associate food with people</u></li>
                <b>Example</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Some people think that they are doing a favour by feeding wild animals, but this can cause them to become reliant on humans, doing the more harm than good. Anyone caught intentionally feeding wildlife is fined $5,000 on the first offence.</li>
