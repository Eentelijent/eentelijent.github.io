            South-east Asia can be geographically divided into 2 parts: <u>main land</u> and <u>islands</u>.
        </p>
        <h4>Geographic features of SEA</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Many waterways and seas</li>
            <li>Many islands</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Trade and contact within SEA</h4>
        <p>Ships before the steam era relied heavily on the <u>monsoon season</u> for reliable travel schedules.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This allowed reliable trade schedules</li>
            <li>This allowed SEA to be a meeting point between traders between India and China</li>
            <li>This brought on the rise of many <u>maritime empires</u> (Thalassocracies)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Notable empires and kingdoms</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Funan (c. 60-500s A.D.)</li>
            <li>Srivijaya (600s-1300s A.D.)</li>
            <li>Majapahit (1200s-1500s A.D.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of these kingdoms would grow to become <u>empires</u> as they expanded.</p>

            <p>Insular/<u>Maritime</u> South-east Asia is made out of >20,000 islands.</p>
            <h5>Island countries in South-East Asia</h5>

            <h4>Geography</h4>
            <p>Insular Southeast Asia is surrounded by oceans and seas.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Oceans, seas and straits provide access to Island South-East Asia</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This <u>shaped travel</u> in the region</li>
                    <li>Such vital connections also shape the <u>economy</u></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The earliest kingdoms and empires in Insular Southeast Asia were formed along important <u>trade routes</u></li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h5>Rivers</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Used less for travel as they were relatively shorter</li>
                <li>Rivers are limited to a few regions (such as in Java, Indonesia)</li>
                <li>Provided fertile farmland for large-scale crop cultivation, such as <u>rice</u></li>
                <ul>

            </ul>
            <h4>Economy</h4>
            <p>Many states were formed along the coasts of insular Southeast Asia due to the importance of islands and seas.</p>
            <h6>Characteristics of early South-east Asian economies</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Empires were based on <u>trade</u></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>These states could become very rich and powerful, e.g. Srivijaya</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Oceans and seas provided <b>food</b>, e.g. fish</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sought-after marine products such as pearls were lucrative trade products</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Many <u>nation-states</u> without fixed borders</li>
                <li>States were based off the <u>personal authority</u> of their rulers (e.g kings)</li>
                <li>Boundaries were not fixed and could change at any time
                    <br>(this is understandable if you play civilisation)

                <ul>
                    <li>Establishment of new villages</li>

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h6>Ruling Authority</h6>
            <p>Rulers were expected to have good characteristics, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ability to demonstrate leadership and display charisma</li>
                <li>Military prowess, winning wars</li>
                <li>Making good judgements</li>
                <li>Economy</li>
                <li><i>Divine stuff, because if your ruler is a god, they can control supernatural effects. (if the rain is shit and all your crops fail, your leader sucks.)</i></li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Divine right to rule</h6>
            <p>Rulers were believed to have divine origins and powers, which is reflected in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Religious symbols and special objects dedicated to rulers</li>
                <ul>

                <li>Formal rituals (e.g. coronations)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Influence of rulers</h5>
            <p>Pre-colonial borders were more fluid and constantly changing as different rulers wielded different amounts of <u>power</u> and <u>influence</u>. As such, the size and boundaries of the state would change accordingly.</p>

            <h4>People</h4>
            <p>Traders from many parts of Asia and the Middle East came to insular South-east Asia to trade due to its <u>openness to trade</u> <i>(the Brits will use this as justification for colonialism somewhere down the line.)</i></p>
            <h4>Culture and Religion</h4>
            <p>The importance of trade resulted in large amounts of <u>social interaction</u> between locals and many different foreign traders. <br> This caused a spread of different <u>religions</u> in SEA.</p>
            <h6>Different religions in SEA</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Hinduism: In Java from 8th-9th centuries<br/>
                Majapahit Empire (13-16th centuries) was a hindu empire</li>
                <li>Buddhism: Co-existed with hinduism</li>
                <li>Islam: became the dominant religion in much of Insular Southeast Asia</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rulers in the Philippines, Malaya and the East Indies converted to <u>boost trade</u> with the <u>Middle East</u>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h7>Paganism</h7>
            <p>Despite the spread of other religions, some people never wholly abandoned their beliefs in spirits in animals etc. (<b>Animism</b>)</p>

        <h3>Mainland South-East Asia</h3>

        </ul>
        <h4>Geography</h4>
        <p>While Insular South-east Asia has short rivers, Mainland South-east Asia has <u>major rivers</u>, <u>large mountain ranges</u> and <b><u><h>river deltas</h></u></b>.</p>

        <p></p>
        <h6>The importance of rivers for travel</h6>
        <p>The many mountains and river deltas made travel across Mainland South-east Asia difficult.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Major rivers were easier to traverse compared to other terrain.</li>
            <li>Major rivers had large <u>river deltas</u>, which were <b>fertile</b> and provided much food and <u>commercial activity</u></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a result, many early kingdoms in Mainland South-east Asia were established at such river deltas.</p>
        <h4>Economies and States</h4>
        <p>Access to rivers and fertile plains enabled many Mainland Southeast Asian kingdoms to be <u>self-sufficient</u> in food production.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rivers like the Mekong were good sources of freshwater fish</li>
            <li>The large deltas of rivers like the Mekong or Irrawaddy were suitable for the cultivation of <u>rice</u> and <u>vegetables</u>.</li>
            <li>Surplus food from fertile plantations allowed more <u>trade</u> between different states</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Locally-produced food allowed kingdoms to be situated <u>inland</u>, while trade could be maintained with sea-side and river ports.</p>

        <figcaption>Fig 1.5 &mdash; Vietnamese rice fields along the Mekong.</figcaption>
        <p>Mainland South-east Asia was not as dependent as Insular South-east Asia on <u>trade</u>. However, the Mekong and Red rivers still served as important <u>trade routes</u>.</p>
        <ul style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">
            <li><u>Moving goods along rivers was easier compared to on land, as roads were more difficult to build and traverse.</u></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Political Systems</h4>
        <p>Like Insular South-east Asia, most kingdoms in Mainland South-east Asia were based on <b>divine kingship</b> and <u>did not have clear borders</u>.</p>
        <h6>How kingdoms in Mainland SEA justified their rule</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Rulers drew their legitmacy from <u>religion</u>, <u>tradition</u> and <u>personality</u></li>
            <li><u>Ability to lead</u> and <u>maintain large governments</u></li>
            <li><u>Regulate trade</u> and <u>maintain irrigation</u></li>
            <li>Military prowess: <u>ability to wage wars</u> and <u>defend their state</u></li>

        <div class="clear"></div>
        <h5>Viet nam</h5>
        <p>Compared to other parts of South-east Asia, Vietnam had a more <u>uniform</u> political system. Vietnam was under Chinese rule for a long time, so Vietname absorbed many <u>Chinese features of governance</u>, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More fixed capital cities (places with imperial organs) compared to other Southeast Asian states which moved their capitals frequently</li>
            <li>Adoption of <b>confucianism</b> and <b>imperial examinations</b></li>
